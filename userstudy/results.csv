12/15/2022 18:32:57,1,3,1,F,"Having floating classes does not help understand what the ontology does, in my opinion. The F representation helps more than the others, but has a repeated edge and has floating classes with no clear relationship to the rest of the model. Had the duplicated edges been removed I would have raised my score. Had the floating classes been related to the rest, I would have raised my score",i40
